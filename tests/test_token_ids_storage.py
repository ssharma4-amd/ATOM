"""`Sequence.token_ids` is an `array("i")`, and what that costs its consumers.

The storage change pays twice: the scheduler's per-step copy into
`scheduled_tokens` becomes a memcpy instead of one CPython int unboxing per
token, and a 100k-token prompt costs 0.38 MiB instead of 3.4.

What it risks is one axis, not one bug: every consumer that was written
against a list. Two kinds, and a silent failure in both --

  compared against a list   an `array("i")` never equals one, so the answer is
                            always "different": a stop sequence that stops
                            nothing, a prefix cache that never hits, a hash
                            that changes with its argument's Python type.

  serialized as a list      msgspec has no encoding for an array, and the KV
                            event publisher counts encode failures instead of
                            raising -- the whole event stream goes dark.

Each is pinned here with a positive control, because a test that only checked
the happy path would pass just as well against the versions that were broken.
The two boundaries where the type is load-bearing assert it rather than accept
either, so a consumer drifting back to a list fails loudly at the boundary
instead of quietly downstream.
