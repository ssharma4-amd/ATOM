"""Stop *strings*, matched on detokenized text.

Stop strings used to be encoded once at admission and matched as token
sequences against `Sequence.token_ids`. That is only correct when the client's
spelling of a stop string tokenizes the same way the model happens to emit it,
and it silently does not:

    "five,"   -> [52670, 11]
    " five,"  -> [ 4236, 11]

A model writing a list emits the second, so a client asking to stop at
``"five,"`` never stops. Nothing reports this -- the request simply runs to
`max_tokens`. Matching the text the client will actually receive has no such
failure mode, and it is what vLLM, TGI and the OpenAI API all specify.

The cost of moving is one boundary: text exists only where a tokenizer does,
which is the frontend, not the engine core. So the split here is vLLM's --
the scheduler keeps every *token*-level stop (EOS, `stop_token_ids`,
`max_tokens`, the `min_tokens` floor) because it can decide those itself, and
string stops live with whoever holds the tokenizer and abort the request from
there.

    `prefix_offset` is settled, and `read_offset` is how far the caller has
    been shown -- and only advances when the newly decoded text is longer than
    the settled prefix and does not end mid-character.
