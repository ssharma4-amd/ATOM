"""Latency model used by dynamic chunked prefill.

A prefill chunk of ``x`` fresh tokens appended after ``L`` already cached
tokens is modeled as

    t(L, x) = c + gamma * L + b * x + a * (2 * L * x + x**2)

The ``a``/``b``/``c`` part is the increment of the cumulative runtime curve
``f(L) = a L^2 + b L + c`` used by SGLang's dynamic chunking, i.e. it only
depends on how much *attention area* the chunk covers.

``gamma * L`` is the extra per-chunk term this implementation adds. Backends
that keep a compressed KV cache (MLA/DeepSeek-style latent KV) rebuild the
whole cached prefix on every chunk, so the cost of a chunk grows with the
prefix even when the chunk itself stays small. That work is paid once per
chunk, so it is invariant to ``x`` and invisible to a model fitted only on
prefix-free prefills - which is what makes an equal-latency solver shrink
chunks far past the point where the extra chunks pay for themselves.

The coefficients are split across two measurements because no single one can
identify all four:

* ``b`` comes from startup profiling. ATOM's dummy forwards bypass attention
  entirely (see the ``is_dummy_run`` early returns in the attention ops), so a
  dummy chunk sweep measures ``c + b * x`` - the MLP/MoE/projection cost - and
  nothing else. Per token that is the same arithmetic serving does, which makes
  the sweep a clean fit for ``b`` and useless for the attention terms.
* ``a``, ``gamma`` and ``c`` are fitted at runtime by
  :class:`ChunkLatencyCalibrator` from the residual ``measured - b * x`` of real
  prefills. The attention terms have to be: dummy forwards never reach them. So
  does ``c``, because a dummy forward arrives at ``b`` without setting attention
  up at all - its constant is not the one a real chunk pays, and pinning it makes
  ``gamma`` absorb the difference.

Telling those three apart needs chunk sizes that vary *independently* of the
cached prefix, which serving traffic does not supply on its own. At a single
chunk size the area column is itself affine in the prefix, so the three are not
merely ill-conditioned but genuinely unidentifiable. Samples taken off a solved
ladder are no better: there the chunk is a decreasing function of the prefix,
which leaves ``gamma`` overstated by around 60% and ``a`` understated.

So the scheduler sweeps two widely separated base chunk sizes over the first few
requests (see ``CALIBRATION_SWEEP_RATIO``), each sweeping a whole prompt, and the
model is fitted once from those samples and then left alone. ``gamma`` is what
decides whether the feature helps at all: an equal-latency solver that cannot see
it shrinks chunks far past the point where the extra chunks pay for themselves.
Until the fit lands, chunking stays fixed.
